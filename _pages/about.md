Self introduction: I am drived by an idealistic and innocent goal, find the theory of everything and then interrogating why. Use this purpose to forge myself and construct my interests. 

**Research Interests: **
Currently, I am interesting in non-equilibrium physics and quantum gravity in terms of quantum entanglement. string theory, including the AdS/CFT correspondence, the conformal bootstrap. My PhD research program is about tending to get a criterion on the theory on black hole interior using information retrieval.
